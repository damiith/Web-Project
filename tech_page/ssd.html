                                For decades, data was stored primarily on mechanical hard drives. These traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) are mostly based on moving parts, like a read/write head that goes back and forth to gather data. This makes HDDs the likeliest computer hardware component to fail.<br>

                                SSDs can be thought of as large USB drives; they use the same base technology. NAND, the technology in solid state drives, is a type of flash memory. At the lowest level, floating gate transistors record a charge (or lack of a charge) to store data. The gates are organized in a grid pattern, which is further organized into a block. Block size can vary, but each row that makes up the grid is called a page.

An SSD controller performs several functions, including keeping track of where data is located.

                            <h2>How SSD read and write data?</h2>
                            <div class="sub-title"></div>

                                Updating data is more complex for SSDs. All the data in a block must be refreshed when any portion of it is updated. The data on the old block is copied to a different block, the block is erased, and the data is rewritten with the changes to a new block.

Each time you ask your computer to retrieve or update data, the SSD controller looks at the address of the data requested and reads the charge status.

When the drive is idle, a process called garbage collection goes through and makes sure the information in the old block is erased and that the block is free to be written to again.

There is another process called TRIM that informs the SSD that it can skip rewriting certain data when it erases blocks. Because there are a finite number of times any block can be rewritten, this is an important process that prevents premature wear on the storage drive.

To further prevent wear on the drive, there is an algorithm to make sure that each block in the drive gets an equal amount of read/write processes. This process is called wear leveling and happens automatically as the drive is working.

Because the read/write process requires data movement, SSDs are usually overprovisioned with storage; there is always a certain amount of the drive that is not reported to the operating system, and not accessible to the user. This allows room for the drive to move and delete items without affecting the overall storage capacity.

                                Why choose a solid state drive? SSDs deliver faster load times for games, applications, and movies. Because of the technology they use, SSDs are lighter and better able to withstand movement and droppage. In addition, solid state drives use less energy, allowing computers to run cooler.

One of the biggest benefits of an SSD is how much faster they are than HDDs. For example, the Crucial P5 is our fastest NVMe SSD, delivering impressive read/write speeds up to 3400/3000MB/s. Even portable SSDs are faster than HDDs. With read speeds up to 1050MB/s1 and capacities up to 2TB, the X8 is up to 100x faster than USB flash drives2 and up to 7.5x faster than traditional hard drives2.
